Enter Inheritance

Student is a Person. Java supports one of the basic Object Oriented Programming Paradigms : Inheritance.

Student can inherit from Person, to model the fact that a Student is a Person.

This is accomplished by using the Java keyword extends, during class definition of Student.

	public class Person {
		// <Person Definition>
	}

	public class Student extends Person {
		// <Student Definition, after reusing Person Code>
	}

Inheritance is a mechanism of code reuse. In this case, all the fields and methods previously defined in Person are available for Student as well.

In this Inheritance relationship, Person is called the super-class of Student. Likewise, Student is the sub-class of Person.
